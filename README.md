### 1. STM32 Nucleo Firmware (C++)
The C++ firmware is designed to acquire biometric data from various sensors using the STM32 Nucleo platform. The sensors and types of data acquisition are as follows:
- Voice Acquisition: Sound acquisition via a microphone.
- ECG Acquisition: Electrocardiographic signal acquisition using an ECG detector.
- Gait Acquisition: Data acquisition related to walking via an accelerometer.
- Potentiometer Test: Oscilloscope test with potentiometer.

Each sensor has a specific datasheet, which can be found in the /DataSheet folder in the repository.

### 2. MATLAB Scripts for Data Processing
MATLAB scripts are used to process the data acquired from the sensors. This includes:
- Voice Recognition: For voice acquisition and recognition.
- ECG Processing: For analyzing the acquired ECG signals.
- Gait Data Processing: For extracting information from gait data collected through the accelerometer.

The scripts are written in MATLAB and are well-commented to explain each step of the processing.

### 3. Detailed Reports
The reports contain a detailed explanation of each case study, both in terms of the code and the reasoning behind every design choice. Each report includes:
- Theoretical explanations of the acquisition and recognition techniques.
- A description of the steps in the data processing pipeline.
- Analysis of the results obtained and any challenges encountered during implementation.

The reports are available in the /reports folder of the repository.

## ☑️ How to Use

### 1. STM32 Nucleo Firmware
To use the firmware, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your computer.
2. Upload the firmware to your STM32 Nucleo board using your preferred development IDE (e.g., STM32CubeIDE).
3. Follow the instructions in the code to start acquiring biometric data via the specified sensors.

### 2. Data Processing in MATLAB
To process the data, open the MATLAB scripts and load the data acquired via the firmware. Each script contains comments explaining how to perform the operations step by step.

### 3. Reviewing the Reports
The detailed reports are written in pdf format and explain each case study, the underlying code, and the reasoning behind the decisions made during the implementation.
